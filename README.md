# Thunder Events

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard--readme-OK-green.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A package for all event planning needs.

This package allows you to cover event registration and ticketing, as well as the scheduling, so you can avoid all those third-party fees and build everything in-house.

NOTE: This is a stand-alone package which assumes you have a database set up independently to store and get data.
